  When using polarcore as a starter theme (and not a parent theme) you can edit either polarcore.xml or local.xml. We recommend being consistent to avoid confusion.

  However, if you're using polarcore as a parent theme, we recommend only using local.xml and leaving the polarcore.xml alone. Then an eventual upgrade will be easier.
